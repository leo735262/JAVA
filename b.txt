Java is a programming language created by James Gosling from Sun Microsystems (Sun) in 1991. 
Java allows to write a program and run it on multiple operating systems. 

The first publicly available version of Java (Java 1.0) was released in 1995. Sun Microsystems was acquired by the Oracle Corporation in 2010. 
Oracle has now the steermanship for Java. In 2006 Sun started to make Java available under the GNU General Public License (GPL). 
Oracle continues this project called OpenJDK.

Currently every 3 months a new version of Java is released. Certain versions are supported for 2 years and are called long-term maintenance (LTV), 
regular versions only for 6 months. The current LTM version of Java is Java 17.

Java is defined by a specification and consists of a programming language, 
a compiler, core libraries and a runtime (Java virtual machine).
